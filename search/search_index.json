Projects can be stored within an AutoCAD drawing, or as a separate file.</p> <p>Embedded projects are stored within an AutoCAD drawing. These projects are automatically loaded whenever the drawing in which they are contained is opened in AutoCAD, making the distribution of projects very convenient. Embedded projects are limited and not able to open or close AutoCAD drawings because they function only within the document where they reside. Users of embedded projects are no longer required to find and load project files before they run a program. A time log that is triggered when the drawing is opened is an example of a project embedded in a drawing. With this macro users can log in and record the length of time they worked on the drawing. The user does not have to remember to load the project before opening the drawing; it simply is done automatically.</p> <p>Global projects are stored in separate files and are more versatile because they can work in, open, and close any AutoCAD drawing, but are not automatically loaded when a drawing is opened. Users must know which project file contains the macro they need and then load that project file before they can run the macro. However, global projects are easier to share with other users, and they make excellent libraries for common macros. An example of a project you may store in a project file is a macro that collects a bill of materials from many drawings. This macro can be run by an administrator at the end of a work cycle and can collect information from many drawings.</p> <p>At any given time, users can have both embedded and global projects loaded into their AutoCAD session</p> <p>When you embed a project you place a copy of the project in the drawing database.

But \n'Application.Wait is unreliable for delays less than a second.\n\n'There is also the Sleep Win32 API, but the Delay() function above \n'works better. But here is how to use Sleep. Place the following\n'declarations at the top of a code module:\n\n#If VBA7 Then\n    Public Declare PtrSafe Sub Sleep Lib \"kernel32\" (ByVal ms As LongPtr)\n#Else\n    Public Declare Sub Sleep Lib \"kernel32\" (ByVal ms As Long)\n#End If\n\n'Now call like so:\n\nSleep 250       'this causes Excel and VBA to go dormant for 250 ms.\n\n\n'Both Application.Wait and Sleep() block the entire Excel interface. \n'Excel literally goes to sleep until the wait period is over. Delay() \n'does not block the Excel interface; it just prevents VBA from \n'continuing until the delay is over.\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"Code/Time/#applicationwait","title":"Application.Wait","text":"<pre><code>'makes the macro pause for approximately 10 seconds\nApplication.Wait (Now + TimeValue(\"0:00:10\"))\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Code/Time/#run-macro-at-specific-interval","title":"Run Macro At Specific Interval","text":"<pre><code>Public interval As Double\n\nSub macro_timer()\n    interval = Now + TimeValue(\"00:00:10\")\n    'Tells Excel when to next run the macro.\n    Application.OnTime interval, \"my_macro\"\nEnd Sub\n\nSub my_macro()\n    'Macro code that you want to run.\n    MsgBox \"This is my sample macro output.\"\n    'Calls the timer macro so it can be run again at the next interval.\n    Call macro_timer\nEnd Sub\n\nSub stop_macro()\n    Application.OnTime earliesttime:=interval, procedure:=\"my_macro\", schedule:=False\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Code/VBA%20Password/","title":"VBA Password","text":""},{"location":"Code/VBA%20Password/#steps-to-break-vba-password-in-excel","title":"Steps to Break VBA Password In Excel","text":"<ul> <li>Convert to Zip and Open Zip go to xl/VBAProject.bin and Copy to New location</li> <li>Open that file in vscode or Notepad and Locate DPB key At End, Change it to DPX and Save File</li> <li>Append this New File to Zip</li> <li>Rename TO xlsm and Open it, Choose yes and Ok for every warning</li> <li>Open VBA code Editor and From Project Property Disable Password Protection</li> <li>Save File and Reopen it</li> <li>You should be able to see all modules</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Code/WindowsAPI/","title":"WindowsAPI","text":""},{"location":"Code/WindowsAPI/#copy-text-to-windows-clipboard","title":"Copy Text To Windows ClipBoard","text":"<pre><code>Function Clipboard$(Optional s$)\n    'Cast to variant for 64-bit VBA support\n    Dim v: v = s\n    With CreateObject(\"htmlfile\")\n        With .parentWindow.clipboardData\n            Select Case True\n            Case Len(s): .setData \"text\", v\n            Case Else:   Clipboard = .GetData(\"text\")\n            End Select\n        End With\n    End With\nEnd Function\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Code/XML/","title":"XML","text":""},{"location":"Code/XML/#read-xml-file-using-msxml","title":"Read Xml File Using MSXML","text":"<ul> <li>Add Reference to Microsoft XML, v6.0</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Code/XML/#sample-xml-file-for-testing","title":"Sample XML File for Testing","text":"XML File <pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n&lt;catalog&gt;\n   &lt;book id=\"bk101\"&gt;\n      &lt;author&gt;Gambardella, Matthew&lt;/author&gt;\n      &lt;title&gt;XML Developer's Guide&lt;/title&gt;\n      &lt;genre&gt;Computer&lt;/genre&gt;\n      &lt;price&gt;44.95&lt;/price&gt;\n      &lt;publish_date&gt;2000-10-01&lt;/publish_date&gt;\n      &lt;description&gt;An in-depth look at creating applications \n      with XML.&lt;/description&gt;\n   &lt;/book&gt;\n   &lt;book id=\"bk102\"&gt;\n      &lt;author&gt;Ralls, Kim&lt;/author&gt;\n      &lt;title&gt;Midnight Rain&lt;/title&gt;\n      &lt;genre&gt;Fantasy&lt;/genre&gt;\n      &lt;price&gt;5.95&lt;/price&gt;\n      &lt;publish_date&gt;2000-12-16&lt;/publish_date&gt;\n      &lt;description&gt;A former architect battles corporate zombies, \n      an evil sorceress, and her own childhood to become queen \n      of the world.&lt;/description&gt;\n   &lt;/book&gt;\n   &lt;book id=\"bk103\"&gt;\n      &lt;author&gt;Corets, Eva&lt;/author&gt;\n      &lt;title&gt;Maeve Ascendant&lt;/title&gt;\n      &lt;genre&gt;Fantasy&lt;/genre&gt;\n      &lt;price&gt;5.95&lt;/price&gt;\n      &lt;publish_date&gt;2000-11-17&lt;/publish_date&gt;\n      &lt;description&gt;After the collapse of a nanotechnology \n      society in England, the young survivors lay the \n      foundation for a new society.&lt;/description&gt;\n   &lt;/book&gt;\n   &lt;book id=\"bk104\"&gt;\n      &lt;author&gt;Corets, Eva&lt;/author&gt;\n      &lt;title&gt;Oberon's Legacy&lt;/title&gt;\n      &lt;genre&gt;Fantasy&lt;/genre&gt;\n      &lt;price&gt;5.95&lt;/price&gt;\n      &lt;publish_date&gt;2001-03-10&lt;/publish_date&gt;\n      &lt;description&gt;In post-apocalypse England, the mysterious \n      agent known only as Oberon helps to create a new life \n      for the inhabitants of London.

But is it worth giving the user this much freedom?
