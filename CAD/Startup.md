# For setting up AutoCAD Start Up macro 

### Using Project DVB Files
- You can store your autocad vba projects in DVB files
- Now If you want to use this macro on any drawing you have to manually load this dvb file everytime you open autocad
- But you can set it up to run it automatically
- First type `APPLOAD` command , it will open new windowd, on that windows there's group called startup suite, click on contents button there which will let you add dvb files for automatically load at startup
