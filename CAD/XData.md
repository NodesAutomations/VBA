## Overview
- Xdata used to assign extended data to any entity in autocad
- For example, If we can assign Pipe Properties to Line Object in AutoCAD
- This is really good method to store additional info on any AutoCAD Object

## How to use XData Manually on autocad
- Use `XDATA` Command to assign extended data to selected object, you also have to provide Application Name which is used to get data later
- Use `XDLIST` Command to view XData Assign with specific object, you really need to know name of application to view data
- Refer : [AutoCAD XDATA](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2021/ENU/AutoCAD-Core/files/GUID-F0299B36-232F-446E-9F81-98F300B36991-htm.html)
